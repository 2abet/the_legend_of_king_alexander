9. King Alexander knew he could not let this threat go unchallenged.
10. He gathered his bravest knights and prepared for the journey to confront Draknor.
11. Oliver insisted on joining the expedition, and Merlin offered his magical assitance.
12. The journey was long and perilous.
13. They traveled through dense jungles, crossed raging rivers, and climbed snow-capped peaks.
14. Along the way, they faced fierce storms, treacherous terrain, and wild beasts.
15. As they neared the dragon's lair, Merlin used his magic to create protective charms for the group.
16. He also taught Alexander and the knights how to wield ancient spells that could weaken Draknor's defenses.
17. One night, while camped near a crystal-clear lake, the group was ambushed by a band of thieves.
18. The thieves were desperate and hungry, but instead of fighting them, Alexander offered them food and shelter.
19. Grateful for his kindness, the thieves decided to join Alexander's quest.
20. With their new allies, the group pressed on.
21. They soon reached the entrance to Draknor's lair, a massive cave carved into the side of a mountain.
22. The air was thick with the smell of sulfur, and the ground trembled with each step.
23. Inside the cave, they faced a series of challenges designed to test their courage and wit.
24. There were puzzles to solve, traps to avoid, and powerful illusions to overcome.
25. But with teamwork and determination, they made their way deeper into the lair.
26. Finally, they reached the heart of the cave, where Draknor lay sleeping atop a mountain of treasure.
27. The dragon was enormous, with scales as black as night and eyes that glowed like molten lava.
28. Merlin whispered to Alexander, "Remember, only the pure of heart can defeat Draknor.
29. Use the spells I taught you and trust in your strength."
30. With a deep breath, Alexander stepped forward and cast the first spell.
31. The air crackled with energy as the spell struck Draknor, waking the beast from its slumber.
32. The dragon roared, shaking the cave and causing rocks to fall from the ceiling.
33. The battle that ensued was fierce and intense.
34. Draknor unleashed torrents of fire and swept its massive tail at the intruders.
35. But Alexander and his companions fought bravely, using their spells and weapons to hold their ground.
36. Oliver flew around the dragon's head, distracting it with clever maneuvers while the knights attacked its vulnerable
    spots.
37. Merlin used his magic to protect the group from the dragon's fiery breath and heal their wounds.
38. Despite their best efforts, Draknor seemed invincible.
39. But Alexander refused to give up.
40. Drawing on every ounce of courage, he cast a powerful spell that he had saved for this moment.
41. The spell struck Draknor with a blinding light, causing the dragon to roar in pain.
42. In that moment of weakness, Alexander and his companions seized the opportunity to deliver their final blows.

43. With a migdhty roar, Draknor collapsed, defeated at last. The ground shook as the massive beast fell, and the cave
    walls trembled with the force of its fall.
44. Exhausted but victorious, Alexander and his companions took a moment to catch their breath and ensure everyone was
    safe.
